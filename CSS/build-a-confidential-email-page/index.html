      <p>Dear Agent <span class="blurred">S'more,</span></p>
      <p>
        We have an emergency. The secret formula for our
        <span class="blurred">Mega Marshmallow</span> has been compromised. This
        formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        We suspect that <span class="blurred">Professor Puff</span> is behind
        this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is
        to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this
        information could jeopardize the entire operation.
